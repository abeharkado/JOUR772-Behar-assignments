## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(tidycensus)
library(ggrepel)
```

## Loading data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
md_pres_vice_data <- read.csv("data/voter_data - president_md.csv") |> clean_names ()
md_pres_vice_data <- md_pres_vice_data |> mutate(total= as.numeric(parse_number(total)))  

pres_election_by_md_counties <- read.csv("data/voter_data - president_county.csv") |> clean_names ()
pres_election_by_md_counties <- pres_election_by_md_counties |> 
  mutate(kamala_d_harris_and_tim_walz_democratic= as.numeric(parse_number(kamala_d_harris_and_tim_walz_democratic)))|>
  mutate(donald_j_trump_and_jd_vance_republican= as.numeric(parse_number(donald_j_trump_and_jd_vance_republican)))|>
  mutate(chase_oliver_and_mike_ter_maat_libertarian= as.numeric(parse_number(chase_oliver_and_mike_ter_maat_libertarian)))|>
  mutate(jill_ellen_stein_and_rudolph_ware_green = as.numeric(parse_number(jill_ellen_stein_and_rudolph_ware_green)))|>
  mutate(robert_f_kennedy_jr_and_nicole_shanahan_unaffiliated= as.numeric(parse_number(robert_f_kennedy_jr_and_nicole_shanahan_unaffiliated)))

senate_overall <- read.csv("data/senate_overall_data.csv") |> clean_names ()
senate_overall <- senate_overall |> mutate(total= as.numeric(parse_number(total)))  

senate_by_county<- read.csv("data/voter_data - senate_county.csv") |> clean_names ()

voter_registration <- read.csv("data/voter_registration.csv")|> clean_names()
voter_registration <- voter_registration |> mutate(total= as.numeric(parse_number(total)))  

elect_2020 <- read.csv("data/voter_data - 2020pres.csv")|> clean_names()
elect_2016 <- read.csv("data/voter_data - 2016pres.csv")|> clean_names()
elect_2012 <- read.csv("data/voter_data - 2012pres.csv")|> clean_names()
elect_2008 <- read.csv("data/voter_data - 2008pres.csv")|> clean_names()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```

**Answer:** We looked at the percentage of Democratic and Republican MD votes for the presidential and senate votes. We found that 64.3 percent of Democratic voters participated in the presidential election, while 55.6 percent Republicans voted in the presidential election. On the Senate, it was 55.6 percent for Democrat and 44.4 percent for the Republican. Split tickets could have happened this year due to controversies surrounding the candidates. Due to how polarized the candidates were, some people decide to vote for one party for presidency and their party for senate versus remain consistent in party throughout the ticket. We think this may be a trend in the past three years.

#Question 2: How many registered voters compared to voter turnout by county? 

pres_election_by_md_counties <- pres_election_by_md_counties|>
  rename(county = jurisdiction)



turnout <- pres_election_by_md_counties|>
  inner_join(voter_registration, by ="county")|>
  rename(democratic = kamala_d_harris_and_tim_walz_democratic)|>
  rename(republican = donald_j_trump_and_jd_vance_republican)|>
  rename(libertarian = chase_oliver_and_mike_ter_maat_libertarian)|>

turnout <- turnout|>
  mutate(total_votes = democratic+republican+libertarian+green+unaffiliated)|>
  mutate(pct= (total_votes/total)*100)

mean_value <- mean(turnout$pct, na.rm = TRUE)

print(mean_value)
```

**Answer:** The average percent of registered voters that turned out by county was 73%.Â 

```{r}
#Question 3: How does the voter turnout compare in counties with different political majorities? 

turnout <- turnout|>
  mutate(
    win= case_when(
    (democratic > republican) ~ "dem win",
    (democratic < republican) ~"rep win"
  ))

turnout |>
  group_by(win)|>
  summarise(
    party = mean(pct)
  )


```

**Answer:** Counties where there was a republican win had a higher turnout with an average turnout of 75% over counties where there was a democratic win which stayed at 69%.

**Answer:** We looked at data from former elections to make a prediction of which party affiliation would win in the next general election. We averaged out the last five elections (including this past one) to make a guess on which part would win based on the numbers and the Democratic Party was the most at 62.4 percent. Republican was at 34.6 percent.

**Answer:** Talbot county had the highest percentage of turnout in the senate race with 79.8% of registered voters actually participating in the election.
